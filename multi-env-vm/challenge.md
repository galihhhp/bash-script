### Challenge 1: Multi-Environment VM Deployment

**Objective:** Create a Terraform configuration that deploys different
VM types across development, staging, and production environments.

- Use Terraform workspaces or variable files to manage environments
- Configure appropriate machine types for each environment
  (e.g., e2-small for dev, e2-medium for staging, etc.)
- Implement proper tagging and naming conventions with environment prefixes
- Create reusable modules for your VM configurations
